recreate a bitmap image using zeroes and ones

// img here

This is a small script that reads from a bitmap image of size 160x60 and writes a zero or one depending on whether the pixel is black or white. 

Currently, this script is very rudimentary. It was created whimsically, just because I needed something good for my desktop background. For personal usage, the pattern on the bitmap needs to be changed. (make sure the pattern is monochrome, otherwise the script won't work)

## Improvements

* Refine the algorithm a little
* Expand the charset of the program (octal? hex?) so that a greater number of colours can be expressed
* add flexibility (ability to change bitmap size, image size, font, color, etc.)
